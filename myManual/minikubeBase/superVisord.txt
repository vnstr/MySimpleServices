-c FILE, --configuration=FILE
 	The path to a supervisord configuration file.

-n, --nodaemon	Run supervisord in the foreground.

-s, --silent	No output directed to stdout.

-h, --help	Show supervisord command help.

-u USER, --user=USER

	setuid to this user as soon as possible during startup.

-m OCTAL, --umask=OCTAL
 	Octal number (e.g. 022) representing the umask that should be used
	by supervisord after it starts.

-d PATH, --directory=PATH
 	When supervisord is run as a daemon, cd to this directory before daemonizing.

-l FILE, --logfile=FILE
 	Filename path to use as the supervisord activity log.

-y BYTES, --logfile_maxbytes=BYTES
 	Max size of the supervisord activity log file before a rotation occurs.
	The value is suffix-multiplied, e.g “1” is one byte, “1MB” is 1 megabyte,
	“1GB” is 1 gigabyte.

-z NUM, --logfile_backups=NUM
 	Number of backup copies of the supervisord activity log to keep around.
	Each logfile will be of size logfile_maxbytes.

-e LEVEL, --loglevel=LEVEL
 	The logging level at which supervisor should write to the activity log.
	Valid levels are trace, debug, info, warn, error, and critical.

-j FILE, --pidfile=FILE
 	The filename to which supervisord should write its pid file.

-i STRING, --identifier=STRING
 	Arbitrary string identifier exposed by various client UIs for

-k, --nocleanup
 	Prevent supervisord from performing cleanup
	(removal of old AUTO process log files) at startup.

-a NUM, --minfds=NUM

	cumulative, calls, callers. E.g. cumulative,callers.

--minprocs=NUM
	The minimum number of OS process slots that must be available
	to the supervisord process before it will start successfully.
